```

### Email Body

```
Hello xAI Team,

We are the maintainers of LLMKit (https://github.com/yfedoseev/llmkit),
an open-source multi-provider AI framework currently supporting 52+ LLM
providers with 634+ passing tests.

We are planning to integrate Grok's Real-Time Voice API as part of our
Q1 2026 expansion (January-March 2026). This would enable our users—
currently at 50k+ monthly—to leverage xAI's advanced real-time conversation
capabilities across our unified provider interface.

**Project Details:**
- 52 providers currently integrated across 6 regions
- 634+ unit and integration tests
- Strong focus on provider diversity (China, Europe, LatAm, etc.)
- Monthly releases with active community engagement
- GitHub: https://github.com/yfedoseev/llmkit

**Our Request:**
We would like to request early API access to Grok's Real-Time Voice API
to begin integration work this month. Our timeline is:
- Week 1-2 (Jan 6-17): Initial integration and testing
- Week 2-3 (Jan 13-24): Full real-time voice feature completion
- End of Month: Release v0.2.0 with 15+ new providers

**What We Can Offer:**
- Production integration of Grok in our framework
- Prominent documentation and examples
- Community visibility through our 50k+ monthly users
- Public acknowledgment in release notes and blog post
- Ongoing support and integration maintenance

Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss API access
and integration requirements? We can start with documentation review and
move to implementation once credentials are available.

Looking forward to partnering with xAI to bring Grok's capabilities to
our diverse user community.

Hello LatamGPT Team,

We're the maintainers of LLMKit (https://github.com/yfedoseev/llmkit),
an open-source multi-provider AI framework with 50+ integrated providers
focused on global and regional coverage.

- 634+ passing tests
- Active community with 50k+ monthly users
- Strong commitment to regional diversity

**Why LatamGPT:**

- Opportunity to position LatamGPT prominently in our framework
- Community visibility and adoption acceleration

**What We Need:**
1. Expected API launch date (target: late January 2026)
2. Developer API documentation and SDK
3. Authentication and rate limiting details
4. Testing/sandbox environment access
5. Commercial/partnership terms (if applicable)

**Our Proposal:**
- Full LatamGPT integration in LLMKit v0.2.0 (targeting end of January)
- Dedicated documentation and examples
- Prominent mention in release notes and community announcements
- Ongoing support and partnership

Could we coordinate timing with your launch? We're planning our major
Q1 2026 release for late January, and would love to include LatamGPT
